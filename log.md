# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Starting HTML & CSS

**Thoughts:** Working my way through freecodecamps "Responsibe Web Design Cert", Finished the basic HTML & CSS and will be working on the Applied visual design module later today, so far a great curriculum!

### Day 1: August 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design & Applied Accessibility

**Thoughts**: It was two very intresting modules, Visual Design followed up from the CSS with animations which was intriguing to see how keyframes worked & Accessibility helped learn & understand how we code to help improve our websites for disabled people and the different things to keep in mind while working on a website.
